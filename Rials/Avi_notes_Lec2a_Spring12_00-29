Models are powerd by ActiveRecord
Controllers are powered by ActionController
Views are powered by ActionView (made up of helpers)

# @mixtape = Mixtape.find(params[:id]) in mixtapes_controller.rb
#   the query string parameters (key/value pairs aka hashes) are soaked up by params object so they aren't exposed in the browser. 

Rails stuffs URL parameters in the params object.

Params (a rails object) is made available in all the controllers
The params hash will contain keys and their associated values. 
    {"action"=>"show", "controller"=>"mixtapes", "id"=>"1"}
    
    Mixtape = Mixtape(id: integer, name: string, created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime)

    the route 
      /mixtapes/:id
        whatever the user puts into :id 
          will get globbed into the params hash under :id
          
          { these curly braces are for hashes}
          
          
      
      mixtape GET    /mixtapes/:id(.:format)      mixtapes#show
